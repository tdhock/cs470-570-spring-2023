Practice exam 1

1. We learned that an intelligent axgent can be seen as being composed
   of four interacting components (PEAS). Name the four components and
   briefly describe what each does.

2. For each of the following three task environments, give the six
   attributes (observability, determinism, etc) with a brief
   justification for each. (a) Poker, (b) route finding, (c)
   chess.

3. Given the [[https://www.cefns.nau.edu/~edo/Classes/CS470-570_WWW/Assignments/Prog2-RoadwarriorSearch/Grading/small_tester.html][simple test map]] from the route-finding homework, assume
   we start at node F and want to get to node K. Give the order of the
   first 10 nodes expanded by (a) breadth first search, and (b) depth
   first search.  Break ties alphabetically (choose A before B, etc).
