Route-finding part 1

- Printout of your program output running the [[https://www.cefns.nau.edu/~edo/Classes/CS470-570_WWW/Assignments/Prog2-RoadwarriorSearch/sampleRuns/10sample.html][10-node]] and [[https://www.cefns.nau.edu/~edo/Classes/CS470-570_WWW/Assignments/Prog2-RoadwarriorSearch/sampleRuns/30sample.html][30-node]]
  samples given above. For each one, run the first three expansion
  steps with VERBOSE mode on, to show development of your OPEN
  list. Then turn VERBOSE=off, and let the searches run to completion
  to show the final stats.
- Printouts of your program running the dynamically assigned
  searches. [[https://www.cefns.nau.edu/~edo/Classes/CS470-570_WWW/Assignments/Prog2-RoadwarriorSearch/Testing-Assignment-pt2.html][DESCRIPTION]], [[file:program2_tests2.py][TESTS]].
- Your richly commented and professionally presented code (may be be
  duplex printed).

ATTENTION: when you are showing runs of your searches, *you must
clearly label the printouts*!! Especially: you should carefully state
what input map you are running on! An excellent way to help me out
here is to attach a small snapshot of the graphical layout of the
map...makes it easy to see which map your are running! Extra cool is
if you've asked the visualizer to paintPath the final goal path found
by your search, so that it's showing in red on the map!
